#Explorers Q's ch.4
#1 Differnece between median and 0.5 quantile
#In statistics, the quantiles slice points which are the dividing of probablity distribution. The second quatile, aka divided into two parts, aka 0.5 of the whole,  is the same as the median. 

#2Why runoff medians lower than the mean at ea station
#median is not influenced by positive outliers. These extrapolations are influencing the mean, 
#because of the values added to the sum before dividing by the 
#nth value of the set the mean is taken from. 

#3notice something strange w loc of the stations LOBI and REES, possible explanation
#Yes I can see two observations. These stations have the most pronounced valley signifying end of hydrological cycle in the 10th month of the year. Also, I see varying altitude difference with the altitude slightly higher, yes closer to the sea yet higher. This is very peculiar given that Netherlands is under sea-level primarily. 

#4Which months, seasons, years with the highest/lowest runoff at ea loc
