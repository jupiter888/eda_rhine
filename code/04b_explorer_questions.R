#Explorers Q's ch.4
#1 Differnece between median and 0.5 quantile
#In statistics, the quantiles slice points which are the dividing of probablity distribution. The second quatile, aka divided into two parts, aka 0.5 of the whole,  is the same as the median. 

#2Why runoff medians lower than the mean at ea station
#median is not influenced by positive outliers. These extrapolations are influencing the mean, 
#because of the values added to the sum before dividing by the 
#nth value of the set the mean is taken from. 

#3notice something strange w loc of the stations LOBI and REES, possible explanation
