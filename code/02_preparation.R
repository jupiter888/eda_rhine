#^With ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function ggplot. The function ggplot creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of ggplot is the dataset to use in the graph. So ggplot(data = rees_runoff_day) creates an empty graph.You complete your graph by adding one or more layers to ggplot. The function geom_line adds a line layer to your plot. The package ggplot2 comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot. For example, to change the plot type we will just replace geom_line to geom_point.

#this is how to view as a point plot instead of a line plot 
ggplot(data = rees_runoff_day) +
  geom_point(aes(x = date, y = value))

#********if we want to have both a line plot and a point plot, we can have them both and transfer aes to ggplot arguments avoiding repetition.*******

#aes mapping is not only about x and y. If we have more than one variables we can plot them using different colors or other aesthetic properties. GRAPHICS!!!! Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of our points

#We can convey information about our data by mapping the aesthetics in our plot to the variables in our dataset.For example, letâ€™s subset our dataset to two stations. We will use the OR argument |

#by adding the 'col' argument, we plot runoff of ea station seperately
