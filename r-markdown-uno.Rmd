<h2>Exploring the Rhine River runoff stations</h2>
<h3>We set out on a mission to prove the hypothesis made by Middelkoop</h3>
<span style="color:Teal;"> “Higher winter discharge as a result of intensified snow-melt and increased winter precipitation, and lower summer discharge due to the reduced winter snow storage and an increase of evapotranspiration.”</span>
```{r}
runoff_stations <- readRDS('data/runoff_stations_raw.rds') 
runos <- runoff_stations[, .(sname, area, altitude)]
runos 
``` 
<i>Discoveries were endless once familiar with the data from the different runoff stations. The data files were transformed into tables using [R]. There were many variables that made observations possible. Altitude, Area, Runoff entries for many years, which ranged from years 1814-2016</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Producing plots helped visualize the outline of the stations dynamics</h3>
<p>Stations at higher altitudes have less area, while the lower altitude stations have much higher area</p>
```{r}
area_altitude <- runoff_stations[, list(area),by=altitude]
ggplot(area_altitude, aes(x=altitude, y=area)) +
  theme(panel.border=element_rect(color="pink", fill=NA, size=20)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=10) 
```
<br>

<br>
<h3 style="color:gray;">We had 20 stations in total, each station had different time periods in which data was collected and available for use. This boxplot gives us a colorful display of when each of these stations data began being recorded:</h3>
```{r}
runoff_stations <- readRDS('./data/runoff_stations_raw.rds')
stations_periods <- ggplot(data=runoff_day, aes(x=sname, y=date,color=sname))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(subtitle="Plotting the time periods of the stations", x="Stations",y="Years")
plot(stations_periods)

```
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color:darkgray;">We see in plots we created that the runoff at the Rhine River stations has definitely changed over the last few decades in an increased rate</h3>
```{r}
runoff_day <- readRDS('./data/runoff_day.rds')
runoff_year <- runoff_day[, .(value = mean(value)), by = .(year, sname)]

ggplot(runoff_year[year > 1980], aes(x = year, y = value)) +
  geom_line(col =  colset_4[1]) +
  geom_point(col = colset_4[1]) + 
  facet_wrap(~sname, scales = 'free') +
  theme_minimal()
```
<p style="color:lemonchiffon;">We used abbreviated names for the stations</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color:mediumturquoise;">While exploring the data after preparation, we were able to present plots that helped better understand the data such as this plot, which shows the longitude and latitude, with altitude gradient for the stations points:</h2>
```{r}
runoff_stations <- readRDS('./data/runoff_stations_raw.rds')
lati_longi <- runoff_stations[, .(lat,lon,altitude,sname)]
la_lo <- ggplot(lati_longi, aes(x=lon, y=lat)) +
  geom_point(aes(col=altitude),shape=16) +
  geom_text(aes(label=sname,colour=altitude),check_overlap=TRUE) +
  scale_color_viridis(option = "C") +
  labs(subtitle="Station Altitudes and Geolocation", x="Longitude", y="Latitude")+
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=3))
plot(la_lo)
```
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color:slateblue;">The following plot was a great representation of the data, and helped draw a powerful conclusion</h3> 
```{r}
runoff_year <- readRDS('data/runoff_year.rds')
merged <- runoff_summary[, .(sname, runoff_class)]
plotted_merged <- merge(runoff_month, merged, by='sname')
ggplot(plotted_merged, aes(x=factor(month), y=value, fill=runoff_class)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~sname, scales='free') +
  labs(subtitle="Stations monthly runoff boxplot")+
  theme_bw()
```
<h1 style="color:Aquamarine;">Middelkoop had made an accurate hypothesis</h1>
<br>
<p style="color:pink;">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<br>
<h3 style="color:dodgerblue;">In conclusion, we can see in this presentation through these plots, the winter runoff has increased due to higher winter temperatures, and increased rainfall. The summers do have an increase in evapotranspiration, and we can observe this through the low levels of discharge in that time of the year. Through the manipulation of data with statistical analysis and patience, these figures give clear results that support Middlekoop's hypothesis. May we all recognize the importance of this information, and continue to strive for understanding our planet we call home</h2>
